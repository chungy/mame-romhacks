            MEGA MAN WORLD 5 DX v1.0
           by kensuyjin33 & marc_max

================================================


One of the most beloved and overlooked Mega Man games, now in full color!

This patch transforms the classic Game Boy game into a Game Boy Color game.

FEATURES
- fully colorized game
  trying to make it as faithful as possible to NES games
- no slowdowns!
  some code pieces were rewritten and optimized to remove all slowdown
  from the original game
- NES styled pause screen
  pause menu looks prettier than ever
- works in real hardware and emulators



SOME SILLY PERSONAL THOUGHTS THAT NOBODY WILL CARE BUT
------------------------------------------------------
I wouldn't lie if I said this has been my most ambitious personal project
ever. You would never imagine how happy I am now to see it finished at last.

MMW5DX is my love letter to Mega Man, to all its fans.

Please enjoy it as much as I did while developing it :-)

Thank you all <3

-- Marc



PATCHING INFORMATION
--------------------
You must provide the original Mega Man V USA ROM:

Mega Man V (USA) (SGB Enhanced).gb
CRC32: 72e6d21d
MD5:   ceb17d831b410d91aa41bf2819cbed82
SHA-1: 9a7da0e4d3f49e4a0b94e85cd64e28a687d81260

Apply the patch here: https://www.romhacking.net/patch/
(some emulators may require a .gbc extension, so make sure you rename it after
patching)



KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- Using an old GBA flashcard (Supercard, etc), palettes don't show up correctly
  Solution: you are probably using and old Goomba plugin, update it
 
- SGB border looks odd in some emulators
  Solution: disable SGB support in your emulator. The hack is now GBC only,
  so it's not SGB compatible anymore
 
- During final boss battle you are amazed by how gorgeous it looks now
  Solution: unfortunately, there is no solution for that :-(
  Hope you don't mind!



CHANGELOG
---------
v1.0 (2022-12-25) - first version



SPECIAL THANKS
--------------
- kensu for joining me in this adventure, thank you bud!
- toruzz for introducing me into the 'color' world and much more
- all MM5DX betatesters for their betatesting and valuable feedback
- 40nix for allowing us to use one of their awesome songs in the teaser trailer
- everyone who supported me since the first day this was announced, it's been a
  long way, but we got here at last :-)



CREDITS
-------
kensuyjin33 - graphics
marc_max - reverse engineering & hacking
kindlypatrick - initial palettes for some stages

During the initial development stages, I borrowed some palette mockups I found
in the net from kindlypatrick, who kindly allowed me to use them.
Their work was replaced as development progressed, but a few of their
palettes are still there, so they deserve credit here too :-)
