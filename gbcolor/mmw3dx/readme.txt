           MEGA MAN WORLD 3 DX v1.2b
           by kensuyjin33 & marc_max

================================================


The third entry in the Mega Man World series gets a coat of paint!
Enjoy the blue bomber classic in full color and defeat Wily one more time
with colorful backgrounds along gameplay fixes and enhancements.

FEATURES
- full color conversion
- slowdowns removed
- NES styled pause screen
- hitbox and animation fixes
- works in real hardware and emulators



ADDITIONAL FIXES
----------------
This game was released with a bunch of mistakes in its sprites and their
animations which have been corrected in the DX version:
- fixed: Mega Man running (facing right) offset and hitbox
- fixed: sprite priority in Gemini and Wily 1 backgrounds
- restored: Super Ball Machine projectile animation now plays correctly
- restored: Metall incorrect metasprite

Since the game has no slowdowns now, a couple of tweaks were needed to be done
to some enemies behaviour:
- Packatto 24 i-frames reduced by one
- red trap allowed standing frames increased by one

Additionally, a slight change has been done to the infamous Dust Man
scrolling room for a better experience.
