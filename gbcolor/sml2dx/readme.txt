WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
Super Mario Land 2 DX is a romhack of the original Super
Mario Land 2 for the GameBoy that turns the game into a
GameBoy Color game. It adds color, lets you play with
Luigi (with different physics) and removes the lag.

You can switch characters on the overworld with Select.


HOW DO I APPLY THIS PATCH?
--------------------------
You have to use an IPS patching program (e.g. Lunar IPS)
on a Super Mario Land 2 v1.0 (UE) ROM. You can also use the
patch ended in "_jap" on a Super Mario Land 2 v1.0 (J) ROM.


WHAT IF MY ROM IS A V1.2?
-------------------------
It won't work.


DOES THIS WORK ON REAL HARDWARE?
--------------------------------
Yes!


I FOUND A BUG!
--------------
This hack has had a lot of emulator-specific issues, so please
make sure this isn't one. Try to recreate it on an accurate
emulator like BGB or in real hardware to consider it a bug.
If you actually found one, I would really appreciate it if
you'd let me know.


RANDOMIZED ROM HAS WEIRDLY COLORED ENEMIES
------------------------------------------
In some levels the palettes are changed on the fly to
make up for the all the palettes the enemies need, so that's
normal behaviour. But this is even more random, isn't it?


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- Wario may take off the wrong shoe.


SPECIAL THANKS
--------------
JuananBow for a really quick betatesting!
th3squirr3l, Oh_DeeR and the rest of the SML2 speedrun
community for their valuable feedback.
