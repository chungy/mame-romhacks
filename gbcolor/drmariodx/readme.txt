                DR MARIO DX v2.1
           by kensuyjin33 & marc_max

================================================


This patch transforms Dr. Mario Game Boy game into a Game Boy Color
game.

Enjoy the Game Boy classic now in full color with a very cool new
feature: character selection!

That's it! Dr. Luigi, Dr. Daisy and Dr. Wario join the virus battle!
Choose your favorite character, each one with their own sprite, palettes
and even virus to defeat.
You can even link up in the competitive multiplayer game, each player
will be able to choose their favorite doctor.


It works in all Game Boy compatible consoles (GB, GBC, GBA and GBA SP),
and, of course, emulators.

CREDITS
-------
kensuyjin33 - v2.0 graphics
Da_GPer - legacy v1.0 graphics
marc_max - reverse engineering & hacking

I also feel like crediting CowboyJoseph64 and Shugo. They are the authors from
Dr. Luigi hacks for Game Boy and NES respectively, which were the inspiration
to add him in v2.0. We also borrowed temporarily a few graphics from both their
hacks during the development, although we ended up doing new graphics from
scratch.
