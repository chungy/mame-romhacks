 1. Introduction
______________________________________________________________________


 Demo World is a hack of Mario World which, while it only has a few
 modified levels, is rather unique in that it implements an animated
 "breakable brick" in the style of Mario 3.  The brick can be broken
 only when Mario hits it from below when he's not small or from the
 side with a cape.  It will also turn into a coin when you hit a POW.
 There are a couple other custom blocks in this hack as well, such as
 a block that will break only when Mario hits it with a fireball, and
 a Mario 3 style frozen coin.

 Feel free to borrow the assembler of the blocks for your own hack if
 you like, but just remember that Demo World requires Lunar Magic
 version 1.30 or higher for editing.

 Also, please don't email me any questions on this hack.  If you want
 to know how to get started on examining the assembler for the blocks,
 just go read the "Map16 Gameplay" section under "Additional
 Information" in Lunar Magic's help file (for version 1.30 or above).
