This fixed version includes:

(1) Pit / Feet Fix - You can continue pushing UP while exiting a pit without falling back in.

(2) All Neocomputer fixes from 2013, BUT with the default / Color mode with ORIGINAL difficulty and energy scoring (i.e., energy reduced for walking, running, or hovering, and leftover energy added to score at the end of a round), and B&W mode with their easier difficulty (energy) option.

(3) Ninja ET only with 3 candies given to Elliot, and 3 held by ET at the end of a round.
