Visit www.hacking-cult.org for updates (let's hope there won't be any...).

Thanks to Hivebrain for his awesome disassembly of S1 (mine was a bit less accurate and Hive's has a ton of commented stuff)


 Updates
---------

 v1.1
======

 + added Tails' tails in all animations
 + added Tails' swimming, tired and tired after swimming animations (ported from s&k, so don't bitch about them plz)
 + fixed that annoying bug that blocked you after flying
 + fixed some annoying bugs
 = I decided not to fix graphical "bugs", because I suck at art. I need someone who is better in this than me 


 What's this?
--------------

This is a hack of Sonic 1, featuring Tails instead of Sonic. Tails can fly, spindash, etc, unlike Sonic.
I replaced all graphics, texts etc. There's no Sonic in this game :)
The only places where I left "Sonic The Hedgehog" were the title screen and ending sequence, because that's the name of a game =)


 Source code
-------------

Yeah, there are two versions of this hack. One comes with source, one doesn't. The source is uncommented (sorry).
If there will be need for a commented version of source code, I might make one.


-------------

Have fun!
And make more fucking sweet hacks like this one =)
