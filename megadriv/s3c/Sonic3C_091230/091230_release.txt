"Sonic 3 Complete" 091230


Changes since 091224

Fixes for previous issues specific to this modification:

- Stage music should now return to the correct speed after transforming, or 
  collecting or losing speed shoes, during 1up music.
- Fixes to handling of music speed for Tails only.
- Clarified change list:
  + Big Arm makes two sweeps instead of four like in Sonic 3, but still can't 
    hit when super.
  + Transformation can be invoked by holding C and pressing B, rather than 
    having to mash both.

New bugfixes:

- Collecting extra lives will not increase the counter past 99.
- Fixed possible Marble Garden 2 boss corruption after killing a Spiker with
  hyper dash.



New features:

Included various music-related IPS patches.  These only apply to this ROM:

sk_main_themes.ips         - Uses the title, invincibility, extra life and
                             unused game complete music from S&K rather
                             than S3.
sk_credits.ips             - Uses the final S&K version of the credits
                             theme.
ssz_ending.ips             - Restores the Sky Sanctuary theme to the ending
                             in place of the Sonic 3 credits track.
sk_knux_miniboss.ips       - Uses the S&K themes for Knuckles and minibosses.
                             NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE FOLLOWING PATCH.
knux_hpz_special_theme.ips - Uses the S3 Knuckles theme and S&K miniboss theme. 
                             The S3 miniboss theme is used only when fighting
                             Knuckles.  NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE PREVIOUS PATCH.
act_complete_fade.ips      - Brings back S&K style music fade before the act
                             complete screen.
after_zone_music.ips       - Brings back post-zone-complete music.
                              If you want to apply this patch only to certain 
			      zones using something like IPSelect, the hunks  
			      are in the following order:
                                CNZ (Knuckles)
                                AIZ
                                HCZ
                                MGZ (Sonic/Tails)
                                MGZ (Knuckles)
                                CNZ (Sonic/Tails)
                                FBZ
                                ICZ*
                                MHZ
                                SOZ
                                LRZ (Sonic/Tails)

                                *LBZ Sonic/Tails follows ICZ in the original.  
				The added Big Arm stuff means this shouldn't be 
				restored so it has no patch hunk.  Knuckles 
				never had the act music resume in LBZ anyway.
