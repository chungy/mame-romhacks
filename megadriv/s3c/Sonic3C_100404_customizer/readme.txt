HOW TO USE THE CUSTOMIZER
=========================

1. Extract all of this archive to a folder of your choice.

2. Download Sonic 3 Complete, if you have not already done so. Make sure you are 
   using the correct version of Sonic 3 Complete to match this set of patches 
   (download the latest version of both from 
   http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_3_Complete_%28hack%29 if you are not sure.)

3. Copy the Sonic 3 Complete ROM (extract it from the archive first if it's in 
   one) to the same folder as you extracted the customizer.

4. Rename the Sonic 3 Complete ROM to Sonic3C.bin if it is currently named 
   otherwise.

5. Run customizer.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
