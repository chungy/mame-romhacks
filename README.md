# MAME ROM-hack software lists (extras)

Ancillary files from ROM hacks, when they come with them (usually at
least a README file is provided).  Patches themselves are mostly not
included, except for optional patches (eg, Sonic 3 Complete has a lot
of them), when the list/combinations to have in the normal software
list would become unwieldly.
